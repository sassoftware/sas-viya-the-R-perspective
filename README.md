# SAS Viya: The R Perspective

Yue Qi, Kevin D Smith & Xiangxiang Meng

This project contains the sample code for the book *SAS Viya: The R
Perspective*.  All examples are in the form of
[R markdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

## Description

Learn how to access analytics from SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS)
using R and the SAS速 Viya速 platform.

SAS速 Viya速: The R Perspective is a general-purpose introduction to
using R with the SAS Viya platform. SAS Viya is a high-performance,
fault-tolerant analytics architecture that can be deployed on both
public and private cloud infrastructures. This book introduces an
entirely new way of using SAS statistics from R, taking users
step-by-step from installation and fundamentals to data exploration
and modeling.

SAS Viya is made up of multiple components. The central piece of
this ecosystem is SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS). CAS is the
cloud-based server that all clients communicate with to run analytical
methods. While SAS Viya can be used by various SAS applications,
it also enables you to access analytic methods from SAS, R, Python,
Lua, and Java, as well as through a REST interface using HTTP or
HTTPS. The R client is used to drive the CAS component directly using
commands and actions that are familiar to R programmers.

Key features of this book include:

* Connecting to CAS from R
* Loading, managing, and exploring CAS Data from R
* Executing CAS actions and processing the results
* Handling CAS action errors
* Modeling continuous and categorical data

This book is intended for R users who want to access SAS analytics as
well as SAS users who are interested in trying R. Familiarity with R
would be helpful before using this book although knowledge of CAS is
not required. However, you will need to have a CAS server set up and
running to execute the examples in this book.
